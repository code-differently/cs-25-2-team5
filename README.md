## User stories 

### User Story 1
As a comic reader, I want to search for comics by characters, authors, or titles so that I can quickly find and access my favorite comics without scrolling through the entire catalog.

#### Acceptance Criteria
 - I can enter a character’s name, an author’s name, or a comic title in the search bar and it will display the comics by the filters.
 - If no results are found, I see a helpful message (e.g., “No comics found. Try checking spelling or filters.”).
The system displays relevant results that match my query.

### User Story 2
As a comic collector, I want to discover and filter for the rarest comics available so that I can grow my collection with high-value, hard-to-find issues.

#### Acceptance criteria
- I can sort search results by rarity or market value.
- Rare comics are clearly labeled with rarity details (e.g., edition, year, grading, print count).
### User Story 3
As a writer, I want to add new comics to the library so that I can showcase my stories and share my work with readers.
#### Acceptance criteria 
- I receive confirmation once my comic is successfully added.
- I'll be able to look up my comic once it's added.
